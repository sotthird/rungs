###### Abstract

The usage of large language models (LLMs) has grown increasingly fragmented, with no single model dominating. Meanwhile, cloud providers offer a wide range of mid-tier and older-generation GPUs that enjoy better availability and deliver comparable performance per dollar to top-tier hardware. To efficiently harness these heterogeneous resources for serving multiple LLMs concurrently, we introduce Coral, an adaptive heterogeneity-aware multi-LLM serving system. The key idea behind Coral is to jointly optimize resource allocation and the serving strategy of each model replica across all models. To keep pace with shifting throughput demand and resource availability, Coral applies a lossless two-stage decomposition that preserves joint optimality while cutting online solve time from hours to tens of seconds. Our evaluation across 6 models and 20 GPU configurations shows that Coral reduces serving cost by up to 2.79×\\times over the best baseline, and delivers up to 2.39×\\times higher goodput under scarce resource availability.

1 Introduction
--------------

Large language models (LLMs) are being deployed across an ever-widening range of tasks, including interactive chatbots \[singh2025openai, comanici2025gemini\], automated code generation \[chen2021evaluating, zhu2024deepseek, roziere2023code\], and agentic workflows \[yao2022react, xi2025rise\]. No single model dominates this landscape. Models from different families excel at different tasks \[liang2022holistic, chiang2024chatbot, jimenez2024swebench\], and within each family, models of different sizes target different cost–quality trade-offs \[yang2025qwen3, jiang2024mixtral, meta2025llama4\]. Recent industry data further illustrates this fragmentation: no single model handles more than a quarter of queries \[perplexity2026modelswitching\]. As a result, providers must serve many models concurrently. For example, Perplexity serves 46 models behind its LLM-powered answer engine \[perplexity2026modelswitching\], and Microsoft Office 365’s AI features are backed by seven different LLMs from three families \[jaiswal2025sageserve\].

To avoid the prohibitive capital expenditure of dedicated AI hardware, organizations increasingly turn to public clouds to host these diverse models \[openai2023azure, anthropic2023aws\]. As Table [1](#S1.T1 "Table 1 ‣ 1 Introduction ‣ Coral: Cost-Efficient Multi-LLM Serving over Heterogeneous Cloud GPUs") shows, these clouds are heterogeneous, offering GPUs that span multiple generations and hardware specifications. Top-end GPUs (e.g., B200, H100) deliver the highest per-GPU capability but are often supply-constrained. Older and mid-tier GPUs (e.g., A100, L4) are more widely available and substantially cheaper, and they offer comparable or even better cost efficiency per unit of compute or memory than the latest generation.

Together, model fragmentation and cloud GPU heterogeneity motivate a new problem: _cost-efficient, adaptive multi-LLM serving on heterogeneous cloud resources_. In this problem, a serving system is given a set of models with latency service-level objectives (SLOs), the current per-model throughput demand, and the real-time price and availability of different GPU configurations across cloud regions. From these inputs, it must jointly produce two outputs. The first is a _resource allocation_ that decides which nodes to provision. The second is a _model placement_ that decides how to partition each model across those heterogeneous nodes. The goal is to satisfy every model’s throughput demand and latency SLO at minimum total cost. Furthermore, because demand, availability, and prices shift over time, the system must re-solve the problem periodically to _adapt_ the cluster to these changes.

Table 2: Comparison with prior work on heterogeneous LLM serving. Existing systems optimize either resource allocation \[mao2025skyserve, jaiswal2025sageserve, zhang2025cauchy\] or model placement \[mei2025helix, jiang2023hexgen\], but never jointly. Coral is the first to co-optimize both for multiple models under per-model latency SLOs on heterogeneous hardware.

Prior work tackles this problem only in pieces. Existing heterogeneity-aware allocation systems target orthogonal goals, such as spot preemption resilience via cross-region replica spreading \[mao2025skyserve\] and mixed interactive/batch workloads via forecast-driven replica scaling \[jaiswal2025sageserve\]. They share a common limitation: each model replica is treated as a black box on homogeneous hardware, which collapses model placement out of the optimization space. Cauchy \[zhang2025cauchy\] relaxes this for Prefill-Decode disaggregated serving by letting prefill and decode use different GPU configurations, but each phase remains internally homogeneous. As both the examples in Sec. [2.2](#S2.SS2 "2.2 Challenges and Opportunities ‣ 2 Background ‣ Coral: Cost-Efficient Multi-LLM Serving over Heterogeneous Cloud GPUs") and our evaluation results in Sec. [6](#S6 "6 Evaluation ‣ Coral: Cost-Efficient Multi-LLM Serving over Heterogeneous Cloud GPUs") show, the result is not only substantial cost savings left on the table, but outright infeasibility under constrained resource availability. Helix \[mei2025helix\] and HexGen \[jiang2023hexgen\] take the opposite stance, optimizing placement for a _single_ model on a _given_ heterogeneous node set. Wrapping them in an outer enumeration over allocations is intractable. The allocation space is exponential, and each inner placement solve is already expensive. Helix alone reports four hours for a single model on just 24 nodes. As Table [2](#S1.T2 "Table 2 ‣ 1 Introduction ‣ Coral: Cost-Efficient Multi-LLM Serving over Heterogeneous Cloud GPUs") summarizes, no existing system addresses the problem end-to-end.

Solving the heterogeneity-aware multi-LLM serving problem end-to-end poses two key challenges. _First, resource allocation and model placement are tightly coupled, and each has an exponential solution space._ The throughput and SLO attainable on a node set depend on how the model is placed across it. Conversely, the optimal model placement can only be determined once the node set is fixed. Neither dimension can be pruned without committing to the other. Brute-forcing the joint problem is equally infeasible, as the combined search space is exponential in both dimensions. _Second, the solution must be produced in minutes, not hours._ Both GPU availability \[wu2024can, strati2025sailor\] and throughput demand \[stojkovic2025dynamollm\] shift quickly. A solution that arrives too late is invalidated by the very changes it was meant to adapt to.

To address these challenges, we present Coral 111Coral stands for Cost-efficient Orchestration of Resources for Adaptive LLM-serving, an adaptive, heterogeneity-aware multi-LLM serving system. Coral builds on a key observation: given a model and its latency SLO, the throughput-optimal model placement on any node combination depends only on that combination. It is independent of how the rest of the cluster is allocated. The optimal placement is therefore a reusable artifact that can be _pre-computed offline and cached_. This decouples placement from allocation without sacrificing joint optimality. We call this artifact a _Serving Template_. The space of node combinations is unbounded in principle, so Coral enumerates a principled subset. As we show in Sec. [6.7](#S6.SS7 "6.7 Sensitivity Analysis ‣ 6 Evaluation ‣ Coral: Cost-Efficient Multi-LLM Serving over Heterogeneous Cloud GPUs"), this subset covers the cost-efficient regime with negligible loss. Accordingly, Coral adopts a two-stage design. Offline, a Serving Template generator enumerates node combinations for each (model, SLO) pair. For each combination, it uses an ILP to compute the throughput-optimal placement under latency SLO, yielding a library of reusable Serving Templates. Online, a lightweight ILP deploys templates across regions to meet throughput demand at minimum cost, under real-time availability and pricing. Lifting model placement search off the online critical path lets the online solve complete in tens of seconds. This keeps the cluster adaptive to shifts in demand and resources.

We implement Coral as a runtime built on ZeroMQ \[hintjens2013zeromq\] and NCCL \[nvidia\_nccl\], with vLLM \[kwon2023efficient\] as the per-node execution engine. To enable large-scale experiments where running on real hardware is cost-prohibitive, we also build a high-fidelity event-based simulator. We evaluate Coral across 6 models, 5 GPU types, and 20 GPU configurations under varying resource availability and throughput demand. Coral reduces serving cost by up to 2.79×\\times over the best baseline, and under scarce resource availability delivers up to 2.39×\\times higher goodput.

2 Background
------------

### 2.1 Distributed LLM Serving

Architecture- and Phase-Dependent GPU Affinity Modern LLMs are largely built on Transformer-based backbones, but they vary substantially in the structure of their attention and feed-forward layers, including dense full-attention models \[grattafiori2024llama\], hybrid-attention models that replace some full-attention computation with more efficient sparse patterns such as sliding-window attention to reduce long-context memory cost \[agarwal2025gpt, gemma3\], and mixture-of-experts (MoE) models \[fedus2022switch, jiang2024mixtral, agarwal2025gpt, yang2025qwen3\]. These architectural choices induce different inference-time execution characteristics by shifting the balance among computation, memory footprint, and memory-access cost. For example, unlike a dense feed-forward network (FFN), an MoE layer activates only a sparse subset of experts for each token, enabling much larger model capacity without a proportional increase in per-token FLOPs \[fedus2022switch, jiang2024mixtral\]. LLM serving also consists of two distinct phases: prefill, which processes the input prompt, and decode, which generates output tokens autoregressively \[yu2022orca\]. Even for the same model, these phases stress hardware differently: prefill exposes substantial parallelism and can more effectively utilize compute throughput, whereas decode is much more sequential at the single-request level and is often bottlenecked by memory bandwidth, particularly KV-cache access \[zhong2024distserve, patel2024splitwise\]. As a result, the most cost-effective GPU choice depends jointly on model architecture and serving phase, rather than following a single uniform rule across all LLM workloads \[mei2025helix, zhong2024distserve, patel2024splitwise\].

Parallelism Strategies for Heterogeneous LLM Serving Distributed LLM serving commonly relies on four forms of parallelism: data parallelism (DP) \[dean2012large\], pipeline parallelism (PP) \[huang2019gpipe\], tensor parallelism (TP) \[shoeybi2019megatron\], and expert parallelism (EP) \[lepikhin2020gshard\]. DP replicates the model, or a model partition, across devices and splits requests among them, whereas PP partitions the model into sequential layer blocks placed on different devices and forwards activations between stages \[dean2012large, huang2019gpipe\]. TP instead shards individual operators across devices, while EP, used in MoE models and often composed with other strategies, places experts on different devices and routes tokens to the selected experts \[shoeybi2019megatron, lepikhin2020gshard\]. DP and PP are more natural building blocks for heterogeneous serving because they preserve coarse-grained work partitions: DP balances load across replicas, and PP can use uneven stage sizing to match different device capabilities, though it must avoid bottlenecks at the slowest stage \[mei2025helix\]. By contrast, TP and EP require fine-grained, tightly synchronized communication, including all-reduce or all-gather in TP and all-to-all token exchange in EP \[shoeybi2019megatron, lepikhin2020gshard\]. As a result, their performance is highly sensitive to device and link imbalance, making them less natural to scale across heterogeneous hardware.

### 2.2 Challenges and Opportunities

Figure 2: Joint optimization across models. Greedy per-model allocation (\\scriptsize1⃝) causes contention; mixed-GPU replicas produced by joint optimization (\\scriptsize2⃝) satisfy both demands.

GPU Heterogeneity. Serving a single model replica across heterogeneous GPUs poses a new challenge: model placement and resource allocation become tightly coupled and must be jointly optimized, each over an exponential search space. This added complexity, however, unlocks new opportunities.

Fig. [1(a)](#S2.F1.sf1 "In Figure 1 ‣ 2.2 Challenges and Opportunities ‣ 2 Background ‣ Coral: Cost-Efficient Multi-LLM Serving over Heterogeneous Cloud GPUs") shows the most cost-efficient strategy for the prefill phase of Qwen-3 235B \[yang2025qwen3\] under a 1800 ms latency SLO, drawn from the five GPU types in Table [1](#S1.T1 "Table 1 ‣ 1 Introduction ‣ Coral: Cost-Efficient Multi-LLM Serving over Heterogeneous Cloud GPUs"). The winner is a mixed pipeline of three single-GPU L40S nodes and three dual-GPU H100 nodes, with a non-uniform layer partition across stages. Notably, it beats every pure H100 setup (526 vs. 481, 460, 476 Tok/s/USD). This shows that mid-tier GPUs can substitute for top-tier ones while _improving_ cost efficiency. The benefit is especially pronounced when top-tier supply is scarce and helps ease contention among models. We observe similar patterns across other models and GPU combinations.

Fig. [1(b)](#S2.F1.sf2 "In Figure 1 ‣ 2.2 Challenges and Opportunities ‣ 2 Background ‣ Coral: Cost-Efficient Multi-LLM Serving over Heterogeneous Cloud GPUs") reveals a second benefit. With only homogeneous node sets (gray), achievable throughputs are discrete and leave large gaps between plans, forcing allocators to over-provision when demand falls between steps. Heterogeneous node sets (orange) instead yield a near-continuous spectrum of throughputs. This lets the system match per-model demand more tightly and avoid wasted capacity.

Together, these two effects drive the up to 2.79×\\times cost reduction over the best baseline that we report in Sec. [6](#S6 "6 Evaluation ‣ Coral: Cost-Efficient Multi-LLM Serving over Heterogeneous Cloud GPUs").

Joint Optimization across LLMs. The second challenge is coordinating decisions _across_ models rather than solving each in isolation. Fig. [2](#S2.F2 "Figure 2 ‣ 2.2 Challenges and Opportunities ‣ 2 Background ‣ Coral: Cost-Efficient Multi-LLM Serving over Heterogeneous Cloud GPUs") illustrates why a per-model greedy strategy is insufficient. Two models, M1 and M2, share a constrained pool of 2 GPU-A nodes and 3 GPU-B nodes, with the per-GPU throughputs shown on the left. If each model independently claims its most efficient GPU (\\scriptsize1⃝), M1 takes both GPU-A nodes and over-serves its demand, while M2 is left with only GPU-B nodes and falls short. Joint optimization resolves this contention (\\scriptsize2⃝): M1 yields a GPU-A node and accepts a GPU-B node in its pipeline, which frees the GPU-A node for M2 to combine with GPU-B nodes in a mixed replica. Both models now meet demand from the same pool, with no idle resources. Capturing these gains requires jointly optimizing allocation and model placement across _all_ models, which is the key problem Coral addresses.

3 The Multi-LLM Serving Problem
-------------------------------

![Refer to caption](2605.04357v1/x4.png)

Figure 3: Two-stage workflow of Coral. The offline Serving Template generator (Sec. [4.2](#S4.SS2 "4.2 Serving Template Generation ‣ 4 Optimization Formulation in Coral ‣ Coral: Cost-Efficient Multi-LLM Serving over Heterogeneous Cloud GPUs")) pre-computes a Serving Template Library from the provided models, SLOs, and GPU configurations. The online resource allocator (Sec. [4.3](#S4.SS3 "4.3 Online Resource Allocation ‣ 4 Optimization Formulation in Coral ‣ Coral: Cost-Efficient Multi-LLM Serving over Heterogeneous Cloud GPUs")) queries the library to produce a cluster setup across regions that meets throughput demand at minimum cost. The offline stage runs once; the online stage runs periodically to adapt to workload and resource changes.

We formulate the problem of serving multiple LLMs on a pool of heterogeneous GPU nodes as a joint optimization over resource allocation and model placement. Let 𝒢\\mathcal{G} denote the pool of GPU nodes available for provisioning, and ℳ\\mathcal{M} the set of models to serve. Each node g∈𝒢g\\in\\mathcal{G} has a provisioning cost p​(g)≥0p(g)\\geq 0. For each model m∈ℳm\\in\\mathcal{M}, let TmT\_{m} be its required throughput under a given latency SLO.

A serving strategy is specified by two functions. For each model mm, the resource allocation Φ\\Phi chooses a replica count nm≥1n\_{m}\\geq 1 and assigns each replica a disjoint subset of nodes:

Φ​(m)\=(Gm1,…,Gmnm),Gmi⊆𝒢,Gmi∩Gm′j\=∅​ for ​(m,i)≠(m′,j).\\begin{gathered}\\Phi(m)=\\bigl(G\_{m}^{1},\\dots,G\_{m}^{n\_{m}}\\bigr),\\quad G\_{m}^{i}\\subseteq\\mathcal{G},\\\\ G\_{m}^{i}\\cap G\_{m^{\\prime}}^{j}=\\varnothing\\text{ for }(m,i)\\neq(m^{\\prime},j).\\end{gathered}

The model placement Ψ\\Psi, for each replica GmiG\_{m}^{i}, specifies a hybrid pipeline- and data-parallel layout: the number of pipeline stages, the partition of the model’s layers across stages, and the assignment of each node g∈Gmig\\in G\_{m}^{i} to a stage. Multiple nodes may map to the same stage. In this case, they hold an identical set of layers and share the load, i.e., data-parallel replication within the stage. Following prior work \[mei2025helix, jiang2023hexgen\], we restrict inter-node parallelism to PP and DP, since tensor and expert parallelism shard work symmetrically and run at the speed of the slowest participating device, making them unsuitable for heterogeneous GPU mixes. Within a node, where GPUs are homogeneous and share high-bandwidth interconnects, TP and EP remain available.

We write T​(Ψ​(Gmi))T\\!\\bigl(\\Psi(G\_{m}^{i})\\bigr) for the throughput of replica ii of model mm under model placement Ψ\\Psi. The multi-LLM serving problem jointly optimizes Φ\\Phi and Ψ\\Psi to minimize total provisioning cost subject to per-model latency and throughput requirements:

minΦ,Ψ\\displaystyle\\min\_{\\Phi,\\,\\Psi}\\quad

∑m∈ℳ∑i\=1nm∑g∈Gmip​(g)\\displaystyle\\sum\_{m\\in\\mathcal{M}}\\sum\_{i=1}^{n\_{m}}\\sum\_{g\\in G\_{m}^{i}}p(g)

s.t.

∑i\=1nmT​(Ψ​(Gmi))≥Tm,\\displaystyle\\sum\_{i=1}^{n\_{m}}T\\!\\bigl(\\Psi(G\_{m}^{i})\\bigr)\\;\\geq\\;T\_{m},\\quad

∀m∈ℳ.\\displaystyle\\forall\\,m\\in\\mathcal{M}.

4 Optimization Formulation in Coral
-----------------------------------

### 4.1 Solution Overview

Naive Enumeration is Intractable. A naive approach to finding the optimal serving strategy (Φ,Ψ)(\\Phi,\\Psi) enumerates all resource allocation plans, computes the optimal model placement for each replica in each plan, and selects the lowest-cost result. However, both subproblems have exponential search spaces. This makes the approach intractable at scale, where pools may span thousands of nodes across tens of GPU configurations and multiple regions. As a concrete data point, Helix \[mei2025helix\] requires a 4-hour search budget to find a throughput-optimal placement for a single model on just 24 nodes, even _without_ a latency SLO constraint. The latency SLO further compounds the already combinatorial spaces of both resource allocation and model placement, since feasibility depends on end-to-end latency that can only be evaluated after a full placement is fixed. As a result, computing even a single global solution is impractical, let alone re-solving online to adapt the cluster to fluctuating throughput demands and resource availability.

Key Insight. To jointly optimize Φ\\Phi and Ψ\\Psi while keeping the solve time short enough for repeated online execution, we exploit a key substructure of the problem. Once the model and latency SLO are fixed, the throughput-optimal placement Ψ∗​(𝒢′)\\Psi^{\*}(\\mathcal{G}^{\\prime}) on a set of nodes 𝒢′\\mathcal{G}^{\\prime} depends only on 𝒢′\\mathcal{G}^{\\prime} itself, independent of how the remaining nodes are allocated. We can therefore enumerate node combinations for each model, pre-compute offline the throughput-optimal model placement that satisfies the SLO, and cache the result for the online resource allocator to query. We call each such cached, reusable artifact a Serving Template. Theoretically, this decomposition is lossless: any valid Φ\\Phi and Ψ\\Psi can be expressed if all possible node combinations are cached. Because the actual space of combinations is infinite, Coral approximates the joint space by enumerating only a principled subset (Sec. [4.2](#S4.SS2 "4.2 Serving Template Generation ‣ 4 Optimization Formulation in Coral ‣ Coral: Cost-Efficient Multi-LLM Serving over Heterogeneous Cloud GPUs")). We will show in Sec. [6.7](#S6.SS7 "6.7 Sensitivity Analysis ‣ 6 Evaluation ‣ Coral: Cost-Efficient Multi-LLM Serving over Heterogeneous Cloud GPUs") that this approximation has negligible performance impact. Crucially, the decomposition moves model placement search off the online critical path, allowing the resource allocator to finish in tens of seconds rather than hours.

Two-Stage Workflow. Following this insight, Coral decomposes multi-LLM serving into two stages (Fig. [3](#S3.F3 "Figure 3 ‣ 3 The Multi-LLM Serving Problem ‣ Coral: Cost-Efficient Multi-LLM Serving over Heterogeneous Cloud GPUs")). Offline, the Serving Template generator (Sec. [4.2](#S4.SS2 "4.2 Serving Template Generation ‣ 4 Optimization Formulation in Coral ‣ Coral: Cost-Efficient Multi-LLM Serving over Heterogeneous Cloud GPUs")) enumerates node combinations for each (m,ℓ)(m,\\ell) pair and uses integer linear programming (ILP) to find the throughput-optimal model placement satisfying ℓ\\ell on each combination. The resulting templates form the _Serving Template Library_. Online, the resource allocator (Sec. [4.3](#S4.SS3 "4.3 Online Resource Allocation ‣ 4 Optimization Formulation in Coral ‣ Coral: Cost-Efficient Multi-LLM Serving over Heterogeneous Cloud GPUs")) queries this library to select and instantiate templates across regions, meeting throughput demand at minimum cost subject to resource availability. The offline stage is amortized across all subsequent online allocations, which run in tens of seconds and let the cluster adapt to workload and resource changes.

### 4.2 Serving Template Generation

As Fig. [3](#S3.F3 "Figure 3 ‣ 3 The Multi-LLM Serving Problem ‣ Coral: Cost-Efficient Multi-LLM Serving over Heterogeneous Cloud GPUs") shows, the Serving Template generator takes as input the set of models to serve, each model’s latency SLO, and the GPU configurations under consideration. It produces the Serving Template Library as described in Sec. [4.1](#S4.SS1 "4.1 Solution Overview ‣ 4 Optimization Formulation in Coral ‣ Coral: Cost-Efficient Multi-LLM Serving over Heterogeneous Cloud GPUs").

Serving Template. Formally, a Serving Template for model mm under latency SLO ℓ\\ell is a tuple τ\=(m,ℓ,𝒢′,Ψ∗​(𝒢′))\\tau=(m,\\,\\ell,\\,\\mathcal{G}^{\\prime},\\,\\Psi^{\*}(\\mathcal{G}^{\\prime})). Here 𝒢′\\mathcal{G}^{\\prime} denotes a set of nodes from a single region. Templates do not span multiple regions, because inter-region network latency (typically tens to hundreds of milliseconds depending on geography) is prohibitive even for pipeline-parallel communication in LLM serving. For a given mm and ℓ\\ell, two templates are equivalent if the number of nodes of each GPU configuration is the same. Ψ∗​(𝒢′)\\Psi^{\*}(\\mathcal{G}^{\\prime}) is the throughput-optimal model placement for serving mm on 𝒢′\\mathcal{G}^{\\prime} subject to ℓ\\ell, from which the template’s throughput T​(τ):=T​(Ψ∗​(𝒢′))T(\\tau):=T\\!\\bigl(\\Psi^{\*}(\\mathcal{G}^{\\prime})\\bigr) follows directly. Fig. [4](#S4.F4 "Figure 4 ‣ 4.2 Serving Template Generation ‣ 4 Optimization Formulation in Coral ‣ Coral: Cost-Efficient Multi-LLM Serving over Heterogeneous Cloud GPUs") shows an example with a node combination 𝒢′\\mathcal{G}^{\\prime} of 6 nodes spanning 4 GPU configurations (1×1{\\times}L40S, 2×2{\\times}L40S, 2×2{\\times}A100, 2×2{\\times}H100), and a model placement that partitions the model into three pipeline stages of varying layer counts, with data-parallel replication within each stage.

Figure 4: Illustration of a Serving Template. Each box represents a node, and arrows represent data movement. Nodes in the same pipeline stage hold the same set of layers and share the load. Each request runs on one node per stage and loops back for auto-regressive generation.

Optimal Model Placement via ILP. Given a node set 𝒢′\\mathcal{G}^{\\prime}, a model mm with LL layers, and a latency SLO ℓ\\ell, we formulate the search for Ψ∗​(𝒢′)\\Psi^{\*}(\\mathcal{G}^{\\prime}) as an ILP parameterized by the number of pipeline stages SS.

Decision variables. We introduce two groups of binary variables. Variable xs​jx\_{sj} (s∈\[1,S\],j∈\[1,L\]s\\in\[1,S\],\\,j\\in\[1,L\]) equals 11 iff stage ss holds jj consecutive layers, and variable ys​ky\_{sk} (s∈\[1,S\],k∈\[1,|𝒢′|\]s\\in\[1,S\],\\,k\\in\[1,|\\mathcal{G}^{\\prime}|\]) equals 11 iff node gk∈𝒢′g\_{k}\\in\\mathcal{G}^{\\prime} is assigned to stage ss.

Constraints. Each stage picks exactly one layer count, and each node is assigned to exactly one stage:

∑j\=1Lxs​j\=1∀s,∑s\=1Sys​k\=1∀k.\\sum\_{j=1}^{L}x\_{sj}=1\\quad\\forall s,\\qquad\\sum\_{s=1}^{S}y\_{sk}=1\\quad\\forall k.

The stage layer counts must sum to the full model:

∑s\=1S∑j\=1Lj⋅xs​j\=L.\\sum\_{s=1}^{S}\\sum\_{j=1}^{L}j\\cdot x\_{sj}\\;=\\;L.

End-to-end throughput is bounded by the slowest pipeline stage. Because nodes assigned to the same stage act as data-parallel replicas, their individual throughputs add up. Hence, for every stage ss, we have:

T​(τ)≤∑j\=1L∑k\=1|𝒢′|xs​j⋅ys​k⋅T^j​(gk)T(\\tau)\\;\\leq\\;\\sum\_{j=1}^{L}\\sum\_{k=1}^{|\\mathcal{G}^{\\prime}|}x\_{sj}\\cdot y\_{sk}\\cdot\\hat{T}\_{j}(g\_{k})

where T^j​(gk)\\hat{T}\_{j}(g\_{k}) is the maximum throughput of node gkg\_{k} when it holds jj layers under a per-stage latency budget of ℓ/S\\ell/S. We obtain T^j​(gk)\\hat{T}\_{j}(g\_{k}) from a one-time offline profiling run for each GPU configuration.

Linearization. To remove the quadratic term xs​j⋅ys​kx\_{sj}\\cdot y\_{sk}, we introduce an auxiliary binary variable zs​j​kz\_{sjk} and enforce

zs​j​k≤xs​j,zs​j​k≤ys​k,zs​j​k≥xs​j+ys​k−1,z\_{sjk}\\leq x\_{sj},\\qquad z\_{sjk}\\leq y\_{sk},\\qquad z\_{sjk}\\geq x\_{sj}+y\_{sk}-1,

so that zs​j​k\=1z\_{sjk}=1 iff both xs​j\=1x\_{sj}=1 and ys​k\=1y\_{sk}=1. The throughput constraint becomes, for each stage ss,

T​(τ)≤∑j\=1L∑k\=1|𝒢′|zs​j​k⋅T^j​(gk)T(\\tau)\\;\\leq\\;\\sum\_{j=1}^{L}\\sum\_{k=1}^{|\\mathcal{G}^{\\prime}|}z\_{sjk}\\cdot\\hat{T}\_{j}(g\_{k})

Objective. The ILP maximizes the end-to-end throughput T​(τ)T(\\tau). For a given SS, solving the ILP yields a candidate model placement: xs​jx\_{sj} specifies the layer partition across the SS pipeline stages and ys​ky\_{sk} specifies the node-to-stage assignment. The throughput-optimal placement Ψ∗​(𝒢′)\\Psi^{\*}(\\mathcal{G}^{\\prime}) is the candidate achieving the highest throughput across S∈\[1,|𝒢′|\]S\\in\[1,|\\mathcal{G}^{\\prime}|\].

The ILP contains 𝒪​(S⋅L⋅|𝒢′|)\\mathcal{O}(S\\cdot L\\cdot|\\mathcal{G}^{\\prime}|) binary variables (including auxiliaries) and 𝒪​(S+|𝒢′|)\\mathcal{O}(S+|\\mathcal{G}^{\\prime}|) primary constraints, plus 𝒪​(S⋅L⋅|𝒢′|)\\mathcal{O}(S\\cdot L\\cdot|\\mathcal{G}^{\\prime}|) auxiliary constraints from linearization. With modern solvers such as Gurobi \[gurobi\], solving the ILP for a given SS takes seconds, so enumerating SS over the full range remains inexpensive.

Generating the Serving Template Library. As discussed in Sec. [4.1](#S4.SS1 "4.1 Solution Overview ‣ 4 Optimization Formulation in Coral ‣ Coral: Cost-Efficient Multi-LLM Serving over Heterogeneous Cloud GPUs"), our two-stage decomposition preserves the original search space defined in Sec. [3](#S3 "3 The Multi-LLM Serving Problem ‣ Coral: Cost-Efficient Multi-LLM Serving over Heterogeneous Cloud GPUs") if all node combinations are pre-computed and cached. However, since the space of node combinations is unbounded, we must restrict enumeration to a principled subset. Specifically, for each model, we evaluate only combinations containing at most NmaxN\_{\\max} nodes and a total GPU memory capacity below ρ\\rho times the model size. Combinations exceeding these thresholds suffer from higher communication overheads and are typically dominated by dividing those same resources into multiple smaller replicas. As a result, the resource allocator rarely selects them, and as we demonstrate in Sec. [6.7](#S6.SS7 "6.7 Sensitivity Analysis ‣ 6 Evaluation ‣ Coral: Cost-Efficient Multi-LLM Serving over Heterogeneous Cloud GPUs"), this pruning strategy has a negligible impact on the most cost efficient Serving Template we can find. The resulting library yields thousands to tens of thousands of templates per (m,ℓ)(m,\\ell) pair. Because each ILP is small and independent, library generation is highly parallelizable, taking a few minutes for smaller models and tens of minutes for larger ones under moderate NmaxN\_{\\max} and ρ\\rho (Sec. [6.7](#S6.SS7 "6.7 Sensitivity Analysis ‣ 6 Evaluation ‣ Coral: Cost-Efficient Multi-LLM Serving over Heterogeneous Cloud GPUs")).

### 4.3 Online Resource Allocation

As illustrated in Fig. [3](#S3.F3 "Figure 3 ‣ 3 The Multi-LLM Serving Problem ‣ Coral: Cost-Efficient Multi-LLM Serving over Heterogeneous Cloud GPUs"), the online resource allocator takes as input the pre-computed Serving Template Library, the current throughput demand for each model, and the real-time availability and pricing of GPU configurations across regions. It solves a second ILP to determine the optimal cluster allocation, minimizing total provisioning and initialization costs subject to throughput and availability constraints.

Serving Instance. To map offline templates to online allocations, we define a _Serving Instance_ as the physical instantiation of a Serving Template within a specific region. Each instance provisions the exact node combination 𝒢′\\mathcal{G}^{\\prime} specified by its template and serves a single model replica using the pre-computed optimal model placement Ψ∗​(𝒢′)\\Psi^{\*}(\\mathcal{G}^{\\prime}). By treating Serving Instances as the fundamental building blocks, the allocator abstracts away the complexity of model placement, reducing the online problem to simply choosing which templates to instantiate and where.

Optimal Resource Allocation via ILP. Let ℛ\\mathcal{R} denote the set of available cloud regions and 𝒞\\mathcal{C} the set of GPU configurations. For each r∈ℛr\\in\\mathcal{R} and c∈𝒞c\\in\\mathcal{C}, let Ar​(c)≥0A\_{r}(c)\\geq 0 be the current number of available nodes, and pr​(c)p\_{r}(c) the per-node provisioning cost. For each model m∈ℳm\\in\\mathcal{M} with throughput requirement TmT\_{m} under latency SLO ℓm\\ell\_{m}, the prior offline stage produces NmN\_{m} valid Serving Templates; we denote the ii\-th template as τim\\tau^{m}\_{i}, let T​(τim)T(\\tau^{m}\_{i}) be its throughput, and let Uc​(τim)U\_{c}(\\tau^{m}\_{i}) be the number of type-cc nodes it requires. As a shorthand, we write

pr​(τim):=∑c∈𝒞pr​(c)⋅Uc​(τim)p\_{r}(\\tau^{m}\_{i})\\;:=\\;\\sum\_{c\\in\\mathcal{C}}p\_{r}(c)\\cdot U\_{c}(\\tau^{m}\_{i})

for the total provisioning cost of instantiating τim\\tau^{m}\_{i} in region rr.

Decision variables. For each template τim\\tau^{m}\_{i} and region rr, a non-negative integer variable νr​(τim)\\nu\_{r}(\\tau^{m}\_{i}) specifies the number of Serving Instances to deploy.

Constraints. For every region rr and configuration cc, the number of nodes consumed cannot exceed availability:

∑m∈ℳ∑i\=1NmUc​(τim)⋅νr​(τim)≤Ar​(c).\\sum\_{m\\in\\mathcal{M}}\\sum\_{i=1}^{N\_{m}}U\_{c}(\\tau^{m}\_{i})\\cdot\\nu\_{r}(\\tau^{m}\_{i})\\;\\leq\\;A\_{r}(c).

For every model mm, aggregate throughput across regions must meet its demand:

∑r∈ℛ∑i\=1NmT​(τim)⋅νr​(τim)≥Tm.\\sum\_{r\\in\\mathcal{R}}\\sum\_{i=1}^{N\_{m}}T(\\tau^{m}\_{i})\\cdot\\nu\_{r}(\\tau^{m}\_{i})\\;\\geq\\;T\_{m}.

Objective. The formulation in Sec. [3](#S3 "3 The Multi-LLM Serving Problem ‣ Coral: Cost-Efficient Multi-LLM Serving over Heterogeneous Cloud GPUs") targets a static snapshot, whereas the online allocator must steer the cluster through fluctuating demand and availability. Each newly provisioned instance incurs non-trivial setup overhead (e.g., node startup and weight loading), while tear-down is graceful: the runtime drains in-flight requests without user impact (Sec. [5.1](#S5.SS1 "5.1 System Design ‣ 5 Coral Runtime ‣ Coral: Cost-Efficient Multi-LLM Serving over Heterogeneous Cloud GPUs")). We therefore charge an initialization penalty only on _newly added_ instances. Let νr′​(τim)\\nu^{\\prime}\_{r}(\\tau^{m}\_{i}) denote the number of currently running instances of τim\\tau^{m}\_{i} in region rr, a constant known at solve time, and let Ir​(τim)≥0I\_{r}(\\tau^{m}\_{i})\\geq 0 be a continuous auxiliary variable bounded by

Ir​(τim)≥(νr​(τim)−νr′​(τim))⋅pr​(τim)⋅K,I\_{r}(\\tau^{m}\_{i})\\;\\geq\\;\\bigl(\\nu\_{r}(\\tau^{m}\_{i})-\\nu^{\\prime}\_{r}(\\tau^{m}\_{i})\\bigr)\\cdot p\_{r}(\\tau^{m}\_{i})\\cdot K,

where KK is a hyperparameter set to the ratio of node initialization time to cluster adjustment interval. Because Ir​(τim)≥0I\_{r}(\\tau^{m}\_{i})\\geq 0, the bound is active only when νr\>νr′\\nu\_{r}>\\nu^{\\prime}\_{r}, so scaling down contributes nothing to the objective. This penalty discourages churn between allocations of comparable cost but different composition. The allocator minimizes the sum of provisioning cost and initialization penalty:

min​∑r∈ℛ∑m∈ℳ∑i\=1Nm\[νr​(τim)⋅pr​(τim)+Ir​(τim)\].\\min\\;\\;\\sum\_{r\\in\\mathcal{R}}\\sum\_{m\\in\\mathcal{M}}\\sum\_{i=1}^{N\_{m}}\\Bigl\[\\,\\nu\_{r}(\\tau^{m}\_{i})\\cdot p\_{r}(\\tau^{m}\_{i})+I\_{r}(\\tau^{m}\_{i})\\,\\Bigr\].

Tractability. The ILP has |ℛ|⋅∑m∈ℳNm|\\mathcal{R}|\\cdot\\sum\_{m\\in\\mathcal{M}}N\_{m} integer decision variables and an equal number of continuous penalty variables, subject to |𝒞|⋅|ℛ|+|ℳ||\\mathcal{C}|\\cdot|\\mathcal{R}|+|\\mathcal{M}| capacity and throughput constraints and |ℛ|⋅∑m∈ℳNm|\\mathcal{R}|\\cdot\\sum\_{m\\in\\mathcal{M}}N\_{m} penalty bounds. Although the total variable count can reach the millions, the optimal solution is extremely sparse: a cluster of hundreds of nodes is typically assembled from only tens of active templates. As a result, only a few dozen νr​(τim)\\nu\_{r}(\\tau^{m}\_{i}) variables take non-zero values. The millions of remaining variables stay zero, rendering their associated penalty bounds trivially satisfied. As shown in Sec. [6](#S6 "6 Evaluation ‣ Coral: Cost-Efficient Multi-LLM Serving over Heterogeneous Cloud GPUs"), Gurobi \[gurobi\] solves this ILP in under 1 minute on average even with millions of variables and constraints, which is well within our online budget.

5 Coral Runtime
---------------

![Refer to caption](2605.04357v1/x6.png)

Figure 5: Overview of the Coral runtime system. A central coordinator hosts the resource allocator and request router, which dispatches each request to a prefill Serving Instance and later to a decode Serving Instance. Within an instance, the scheduler assigns heterogeneous engine nodes (colored circles) per pipeline stage. KV caches are transferred directly between prefill and decode engine nodes.

### 5.1 System Design

As shown in Fig. [5](#S5.F5 "Figure 5 ‣ 5 Coral Runtime ‣ Coral: Cost-Efficient Multi-LLM Serving over Heterogeneous Cloud GPUs"), Coral’s runtime system consists of a single CPU _coordinator node_, a pool of prefill Serving Instances, and a pool of decode Serving Instances. The coordinator hosts the resource allocator (Sec. [4.3](#S4.SS3 "4.3 Online Resource Allocation ‣ 4 Optimization Formulation in Coral ‣ Coral: Cost-Efficient Multi-LLM Serving over Heterogeneous Cloud GPUs")) and the request router, which dispatches incoming requests to the appropriate instances. Each Serving Instance contains a CPU _scheduler node_ and a group of GPU _engine nodes_. The scheduler handles intra-instance request scheduling and communication with the coordinator, while the engine nodes execute model inference following the template’s model placement. We describe Coral in the PD-disaggregated setting, but the same design applies to PD-aggregated serving as well.

Request Life-Cycle. When a request arrives at the coordinator, the router selects a prefill instance for the target model via weighted round-robin, with each instance weighted by its template throughput T​(τ)T(\\tau). The request is forwarded to that instance’s scheduler, which then assigns one engine node per pipeline stage via weighted round-robin. These weights correspond to each node’s expected throughput under the template’s chosen model placement. The scheduler dispatches the request to the first pipeline stage, and the engine nodes propagate intermediate activations down the pipeline (standard pipeline-parallel inference). Once the final stage finishes prefill, the result returns to the scheduler, which notifies the coordinator. The router then selects a decode instance, after which the prefill and decode schedulers coordinate the direct node-to-node transfer of the request’s KV cache. Once the transfer completes, auto-regressive generation begins on the decode instance.

Instance Life-Cycle. Coral invokes the resource allocator periodically to adapt the cluster to current throughput demand, resource availability, and node prices. Each invocation produces a new target allocation, and the runtime reconciles the running cluster to it as follows.

Scaling down. For each template whose target count drops below the current count, Coral gracefully terminates the excess instances, starting with the one at lowest load. A terminating instance stops accepting new requests and shuts down once its in-flight requests complete (i.e., _connection draining_). Because each shutdown is scheduled in advance and drains within roughly a minute in practice, draining is preferable to request migration. Migrating in-flight decode requests would require transferring their entire KV cache, which is far more expensive than letting them finish.

Scaling up. For each template whose target count grows, Coral provisions the additional nodes and initializes new instances according to the template’s model placement. This process typically takes several minutes, dominated by node startup, weight loading, and CUDA graph compilation. This is exactly the overhead captured by the initialization penalty in the allocator’s objective (Sec. [4.3](#S4.SS3 "4.3 Online Resource Allocation ‣ 4 Optimization Formulation in Coral ‣ Coral: Cost-Efficient Multi-LLM Serving over Heterogeneous Cloud GPUs")). Once a new instance becomes ready, its scheduler notifies the coordinator, and the router begins dispatching requests to it.

### 5.2 Implementation

We implement the Coral runtime in 53K LoC of Python and C++. The control plane runs over ZeroMQ \[hintjens2013zeromq\], on top of which we build Serving Instance life-cycle management and request dispatching. For intra-instance communication between engine nodes, we build a high-bandwidth, low-latency pipeline-parallel framework on top of NCCL \[nvidia\_nccl\]. This framework supports arbitrary pipeline- and data-parallel configurations and transparently enables Remote Direct Memory Access (RDMA) and GPU-Direct RDMA \[nvidia\_gpudirect\] whenever the hardware permits. For KV cache transfers between prefill and decode instances, we use GLOO \[meta\_gloo\] over CPU-based RDMA. Routing the transfer through the CPU isolates KV cache movement from the GPUs, ensuring it does not contend with model inference or pipeline-parallel communication for GPU resources. We use vLLM \[kwon2023efficient\] as the per-node execution engine; however, the runtime is engine-agnostic, and any compatible inference engine can be substituted without changes to the surrounding system.

To evaluate Coral at scales of hundreds of nodes—where running on real hardware is cost-prohibitive—we additionally build an event-based simulator in 5K LoC of Python. The simulator’s cost model is fitted from offline profiling data collected across every GPU configuration in our pool. Using this model, the simulator advances execution at the granularity of individual pipeline stages on each engine node. As demonstrated in our fidelity study (Sec. [6.2](#S6.SS2 "6.2 Simulator Fidelity ‣ 6 Evaluation ‣ Coral: Cost-Efficient Multi-LLM Serving over Heterogeneous Cloud GPUs")), the simulator reproduces the real system’s per-request prefill and decode latencies to within 5.6% and 7.2% on average, validating it as a faithful proxy for our large-scale experiments.

### 6.1 Experiment Setup

Model and GPU Setup. We evaluate Coral across a diverse set of models and GPU types. The core setup uses three models (Qwen-3 32B \[yang2025qwen3\], GPT-OSS 20B \[agarwal2025gpt\], Phi4-14B \[abdin2024phi\]) on a pool with 12 different GPU configurations (L40S, L4, and A10G, each with 1, 2, 4, or 8 GPUs) spanning two cloud regions. The extended setup extends this with three additional models (Qwen-3 235B \[yang2025qwen3\], GPT-OSS 120B \[agarwal2025gpt\], Llama-3 70B \[grattafiori2024llama\]) and eight additional configurations (H100 and A100 with 1, 2, 4, or 8 GPUs) across a third cloud region. Table [3](#S6.T3 "Table 3 ‣ 6 Evaluation ‣ Coral: Cost-Efficient Multi-LLM Serving over Heterogeneous Cloud GPUs") summarizes the diverse properties of these models. The core setup requires 20–40 GPUs to serve, while the extended setup requires 100–300 GPUs depending on the method. We evaluate the core setup on real hardware for Sec. [6.3](#S6.SS3 "6.3 Cost Efficiency in Diverse Setups ‣ 6 Evaluation ‣ Coral: Cost-Efficient Multi-LLM Serving over Heterogeneous Cloud GPUs") and Sec. [6.4](#S6.SS4 "6.4 Goodput Under Scarce Resources ‣ 6 Evaluation ‣ Coral: Cost-Efficient Multi-LLM Serving over Heterogeneous Cloud GPUs"), and in simulation for Sec. [6.5](#S6.SS5 "6.5 Robustness to Imbalanced Demand ‣ 6 Evaluation ‣ Coral: Cost-Efficient Multi-LLM Serving over Heterogeneous Cloud GPUs"). The extended setup runs exclusively in simulation, as provisioning hundreds of GPUs on real hardware would cost thousands of dollars per hour. To validate the simulator (Sec. [6.2](#S6.SS2 "6.2 Simulator Fidelity ‣ 6 Evaluation ‣ Coral: Cost-Efficient Multi-LLM Serving over Heterogeneous Cloud GPUs")), we additionally re-run the two real-hardware experiments in simulation and compare. The simulator’s prefill and decode latencies deviate from the real system by only 5.6% and 7.2% on average, confirming it as a faithful proxy for our simulation-based experiments.

Workload Setup. Request lengths and arrival patterns are drawn from three datasets—Azure Code \[stojkovic2025dynamollm\], Azure Conversation \[stojkovic2025dynamollm\], and BurstGPT \[wang2025burstgpt\]—which we assign evenly across the models under test. Latency SLOs are set per model based on size and architecture (whether the model uses MoE \[fedus2022switch\] or hybrid attention mechanisms \[beltagy2020longformer\]), following the typical SLOs reported in AdaServe \[li2025adaserve\]. Table [3](#S6.T3 "Table 3 ‣ 6 Evaluation ‣ Coral: Cost-Efficient Multi-LLM Serving over Heterogeneous Cloud GPUs") lists the dataset and SLO of each model. By default, all models share the same average arrival rate (10 req/s for the core setup and 25 req/s for the extended setup), which we achieve by uniformly scaling each trace. Sec. [6.5](#S6.SS5 "6.5 Robustness to Imbalanced Demand ‣ 6 Evaluation ‣ Coral: Cost-Efficient Multi-LLM Serving over Heterogeneous Cloud GPUs") studies how imbalanced arrival rates across models affect Coral, where we assign 80% of total requests to large and small models respectively.

Figure 8: Hourly cost under scarce resource availability. Baselines appear cheaper only because they fail to meet throughput demand (Fig. [9](#S6.F9 "Figure 9 ‣ 6.2 Simulator Fidelity ‣ 6 Evaluation ‣ Coral: Cost-Efficient Multi-LLM Serving over Heterogeneous Cloud GPUs") and Fig. [10](#S6.F10 "Figure 10 ‣ 6.3 Cost Efficiency in Diverse Setups ‣ 6 Evaluation ‣ Coral: Cost-Efficient Multi-LLM Serving over Heterogeneous Cloud GPUs")).

Resource Setup. Resource availability follows the production GPU-cluster trace from Alibaba \[duan2026GFS\]. By default, we scale the trace so that availability is high enough for every method to find a feasible solution. For the low-availability study (Sec. [6.4](#S6.SS4 "6.4 Goodput Under Scarce Resources ‣ 6 Evaluation ‣ Coral: Cost-Efficient Multi-LLM Serving over Heterogeneous Cloud GPUs")), we instead scale it to a tight but feasible level: 25% above estimated demand for the core setup and 75% above estimated demand for the extended setup. Node prices reflect real AWS US-East-2 and AP-Northeast-2 rates for the core setup, with GCP US-Central-1 added as the third region in the extended setup.

Evaluation Duration. Each experiment runs for 30 minutes, with the cluster reconfigured every 6 minutes. We define each 6-minute interval as one _epoch_. We cap the duration here due to the cost of real-hardware evaluation. Because production clusters reconfigure far less frequently, we amortize initialization cost over a 60-minute adjustment interval (i.e., divide by 10). Sec. [6.7](#S6.SS7 "6.7 Sensitivity Analysis ‣ 6 Evaluation ‣ Coral: Cost-Efficient Multi-LLM Serving over Heterogeneous Cloud GPUs") examines sensitivity of Coral to this interval.

Coral Setup. Offline Serving Template generation runs on an AWS c8i instance with 384 cores, with the per-template node cap set to Nmax\=6N\_{\\max}=6 and the total memory cap to ρ\=12×\\rho=12{\\times} the model size. This is a one-time process per setup and completes in a few hours for all models. The online resource-allocation ILP is solved on a c8i instance with 32 cores.

Baselines. We compare against two baselines in the end-to-end evaluation. Homo assumes each model replica is served on homogeneous hardware, but permits heterogeneity across replicas—the same assumption adopted by SkyServe \[mao2025skyserve\] and SageServe \[jaiswal2025sageserve\]. It greedily selects the most cost-efficient (highest goodput per USD) homogeneous strategy for each model. Cauchy, adapted from the PD-disaggregated serving system of the same name \[zhang2025cauchy\], retains their cost-efficiency model and resource-allocation algorithm, but extends their GPU-combo definition so that a single prefill replica can feed multiple decode replicas, yielding more flexibility under multi-LLM serving. Both baselines run within the Coral runtime for a fair comparison. Heterogeneity-aware model-placement systems such as Helix \[mei2025helix\] do not address resource allocation, so we compare against Helix separately in Sec. [6.6](#S6.SS6 "6.6 Comparison with Helix ‣ 6 Evaluation ‣ Coral: Cost-Efficient Multi-LLM Serving over Heterogeneous Cloud GPUs").

Evaluation Metrics. Our primary metric is _hourly cost_ in USD/h, which is the sum of machine provisioning cost and amortized initialization cost (under the 60-minute interval discussed above). For the experiments in Sec. [6.4](#S6.SS4 "6.4 Goodput Under Scarce Resources ‣ 6 Evaluation ‣ Coral: Cost-Efficient Multi-LLM Serving over Heterogeneous Cloud GPUs"), where methods differ in how much demand they actually satisfy, we additionally report _goodput_, defined as the number of generated tokens per second that satisfy the latency SLO.

### 6.2 Simulator Fidelity

To validate the simulator, we re-run the real-hardware experiments in Sec. [6.3](#S6.SS3 "6.3 Cost Efficiency in Diverse Setups ‣ 6 Evaluation ‣ Coral: Cost-Efficient Multi-LLM Serving over Heterogeneous Cloud GPUs") and Sec. [6.4](#S6.SS4 "6.4 Goodput Under Scarce Resources ‣ 6 Evaluation ‣ Coral: Cost-Efficient Multi-LLM Serving over Heterogeneous Cloud GPUs") in simulation and compare the two. We use per-request latency as the primary fidelity metric. Higher-level metrics such as goodput and SLO attainment are derived from latency and the SLO threshold, so matching latency distributions implies matching goodput across the full range of SLOs, whereas matching goodput at a single threshold does not. Averaged across all setups, the simulator’s prefill and decode latencies deviate from the real system by 5.6% and 7.2%, respectively. Fig. [6](#S6.F6 "Figure 6 ‣ 6.1 Experiment Setup ‣ 6 Evaluation ‣ Coral: Cost-Efficient Multi-LLM Serving over Heterogeneous Cloud GPUs") shows a representative comparison for Phi-4 14B: the prefill and decode latency CDFs align closely across the full distribution, including the tail. This confirms that the simulator is a faithful proxy for the experiments in the remainder of Sec. [6](#S6 "6 Evaluation ‣ Coral: Cost-Efficient Multi-LLM Serving over Heterogeneous Cloud GPUs").

Figure 10: Decode goodput across epochs under scarce resource availability (extended setup). Prefill follows the same trend.

This section evaluates whether Coral reduces serving cost compared with existing systems. Fig. [7](#S6.F7 "Figure 7 ‣ 6.1 Experiment Setup ‣ 6 Evaluation ‣ Coral: Cost-Efficient Multi-LLM Serving over Heterogeneous Cloud GPUs") reports the results.

In the core setup (Fig. [7(a)](#S6.F7.sf1 "In Figure 7 ‣ 6.1 Experiment Setup ‣ 6 Evaluation ‣ Coral: Cost-Efficient Multi-LLM Serving over Heterogeneous Cloud GPUs")), Coral reduces the average hourly cost by 1.62×1.62\\times over Homo and 1.60×1.60\\times over Cauchy, while the resource allocation ILP solves in only 0.24 seconds on average. The per-model breakdown in Fig. [7(b)](#S6.F7.sf2 "In Figure 7 ‣ 6.1 Experiment Setup ‣ 6 Evaluation ‣ Coral: Cost-Efficient Multi-LLM Serving over Heterogeneous Cloud GPUs") shows that Qwen-3 32B accounts for roughly 60% of the total cost across all methods. This is expected: among the three models, Qwen-3 32B has the most parameters and, unlike GPT-OSS 20B, lacks MoE or hybrid attention to reduce compute and memory demand. Coral achieves its largest cost reductions on this model (2.02×2.02\\times over Homo and 1.88×1.88\\times over Cauchy), with most of the savings coming from the prefill side. Inspecting the cluster setups chosen for Qwen-3 32B prefill, we find that both baselines assemble the cluster from homogeneous single-node replicas—one replica per 2×2{\\times}L40S node or per 4×4{\\times}L4 node—and vary the mix of the two across epochs to track throughput demand. In contrast, Coral selects Serving Templates that combine L4 and L40S nodes to serve a single replica (e.g., one 1×1{\\times}L4 node plus three 1×1{\\times}L40S nodes), with non-uniform layer partitioning across pipeline stages and data-parallel replication within selected stages.

In the extended setup (Fig. [7(c)](#S6.F7.sf3 "In Figure 7 ‣ 6.1 Experiment Setup ‣ 6 Evaluation ‣ Coral: Cost-Efficient Multi-LLM Serving over Heterogeneous Cloud GPUs")), Coral reduces the average hourly cost by 3.14×3.14\\times over Homo and 2.66×2.66\\times over Cauchy, with an average ILP solving time of 9.68 seconds. The cost breakdown in Fig. [7(d)](#S6.F7.sf4 "In Figure 7 ‣ 6.1 Experiment Setup ‣ 6 Evaluation ‣ Coral: Cost-Efficient Multi-LLM Serving over Heterogeneous Cloud GPUs") shows that Qwen-3 235B dominates total cost: despite its MoE design, its sheer parameter count makes it the most expensive model to serve. Coral again achieves its largest reductions on this model (4.93×4.93\\times over Homo and 4.08×4.08\\times over Cauchy), with most savings from prefill. The cluster setups reveal the same underlying pattern as in the core setup. Both baselines serve each Qwen-3 235B replica with a single 8×8{\\times}A100 or 8×8{\\times}H100 node, a natural choice given the model’s memory and compute footprint. Coral instead uses templates that combine multiple smaller A100 and H100 nodes (1–2 GPUs each) into one replica with non-uniform PP and data-parallel replication.

Together, these results show that intra-replica heterogeneity is essential for cost-efficient serving, as mixing GPU types within a replica lets Coral tailor each instance to the workload’s latency SLO and throughput demand (as discussed in Sec. [2.2](#S2.SS2 "2.2 Challenges and Opportunities ‣ 2 Background ‣ Coral: Cost-Efficient Multi-LLM Serving over Heterogeneous Cloud GPUs")). Across all methods and both setups, the amortized initialization cost remains under 1% of the hourly cost, confirming that the ILP’s initialization penalty effectively discourages churn.

(d) Small-Heavy, extended setup.

Figure 11: Hourly cost under imbalanced demand, where the top third of models (Large-Heavy) or bottom third (Small-Heavy) receive 80% of requests. Coral’s cost advantage grows when large models dominate.

This section evaluates whether Coral sustains goodput under tight resource availability. If a method cannot find a solution meeting every model’s throughput demand, we uniformly scale down the per-model arrival rate until one exists. This preserves the balanced-demand assumption from Sec. [6.3](#S6.SS3 "6.3 Cost Efficiency in Diverse Setups ‣ 6 Evaluation ‣ Coral: Cost-Efficient Multi-LLM Serving over Heterogeneous Cloud GPUs").

In the core setup, Fig. [8(a)](#S6.F8.sf1 "In Figure 8 ‣ 6.1 Experiment Setup ‣ 6 Evaluation ‣ Coral: Cost-Efficient Multi-LLM Serving over Heterogeneous Cloud GPUs") reports hourly cost and Fig. [9](#S6.F9 "Figure 9 ‣ 6.2 Simulator Fidelity ‣ 6 Evaluation ‣ Coral: Cost-Efficient Multi-LLM Serving over Heterogeneous Cloud GPUs") reports per-model decode goodput; we omit prefill because it follows the same trend. Coral matches Homo in hourly cost while delivering 1.24×\\times higher average goodput. Against Cauchy, Coral reduces cost by 1.51×\\times and maintains roughly the same average goodput across models. The allocation ILP solves in 0.11 seconds on average.

Compared to its Sec. [6.3](#S6.SS3 "6.3 Cost Efficiency in Diverse Setups ‣ 6 Evaluation ‣ Coral: Cost-Efficient Multi-LLM Serving over Heterogeneous Cloud GPUs") solution, Coral’s cluster setup here is 10% more expensive on average. The tightest epoch is epoch 1. In this epoch, Coral redirects three higher-end L40S GPUs from Phi-4 to Qwen-3—the heavier model that needs them more—and falls back to A10G and L4 for Phi-4. It also broadens its use of heterogeneous Serving Templates from 1 to 4. The baselines lack such cross-model coordination: Homo greedily selects the most cost-efficient template per model in isolation, and Cauchy encodes per-model cost efficiency directly in its ILP objective. Both designs drive every model to contend for the scarce L40S GPUs, and none obtain enough to meet demand.

In the extended setup, Fig. [8(b)](#S6.F8.sf2 "In Figure 8 ‣ 6.1 Experiment Setup ‣ 6 Evaluation ‣ Coral: Cost-Efficient Multi-LLM Serving over Heterogeneous Cloud GPUs") reports hourly cost and Fig. [10](#S6.F10 "Figure 10 ‣ 6.3 Cost Efficiency in Diverse Setups ‣ 6 Evaluation ‣ Coral: Cost-Efficient Multi-LLM Serving over Heterogeneous Cloud GPUs") reports per-model decode goodput. Against Homo, Coral is 1.52×\\times more expensive but delivers 7.64×\\times higher goodput. Against Cauchy, Coral reduces hourly cost by 1.25×\\times and improves average goodput by 2.39×\\times. The allocation ILP solves in 41 seconds on average.

Compared to its Sec. [6.3](#S6.SS3 "6.3 Cost Efficiency in Diverse Setups ‣ 6 Evaluation ‣ Coral: Cost-Efficient Multi-LLM Serving over Heterogeneous Cloud GPUs") solution, Coral’s cluster setup here is 25% more expensive on average. The tightest epoch is epoch 3, which is also the hardest to solve (2 minutes) and incurs the largest cost increase (53%). In this epoch, the number of heterogeneous Serving Instances jumps from 9 to 19. For the three largest models (Qwen-3 235B, GPT-OSS 120B, Llama-3 70B), nearly all throughput is served by 16 distinct heterogeneous instances, up from 6 in Sec. [6.3](#S6.SS3 "6.3 Cost Efficiency in Diverse Setups ‣ 6 Evaluation ‣ Coral: Cost-Efficient Multi-LLM Serving over Heterogeneous Cloud GPUs") where only Qwen-3 235B relied heavily on them. This complex cross-model coordination explains the long solve time. The baselines again fail for the same reason as in the core setup: all models compete for the scarce A100 and H100 nodes and none obtain enough.

Together, these results yield two takeaways. First, joint optimization across models is essential for satisfying aggregate throughput demand under scarce resources. Second, heterogeneous Serving Templates give the solver the flexibility it needs to resolve cross-model contention.

### 6.5 Robustness to Imbalanced Demand

This section studies how the imbalanced throughput demand across models affects Coral. We consider two imbalanced settings. In _Large-Heavy_, the top 1/31/3 of models by size receive 80% of the requests: Qwen-3 32B in core setup, and Qwen-3 235B together with GPT-OSS 120B (split equally) in extended setup. In _Small-Heavy_, the bottom 1/31/3 receive 80%: Phi-4 14B in core setup, and Phi-4 14B together with GPT-OSS 20B (split equally) in extended setup.

Large-Heavy. Fig. [11(a)](#S6.F11.sf1 "In Figure 11 ‣ 6.4 Goodput Under Scarce Resources ‣ 6 Evaluation ‣ Coral: Cost-Efficient Multi-LLM Serving over Heterogeneous Cloud GPUs") and Fig. [11(b)](#S6.F11.sf2 "In Figure 11 ‣ 6.4 Goodput Under Scarce Resources ‣ 6 Evaluation ‣ Coral: Cost-Efficient Multi-LLM Serving over Heterogeneous Cloud GPUs") report hourly cost for core setup and extended setup. In extended setup, Coral reduces the average hourly cost by 2.79×\\times over Homo and 3.47×\\times over Cauchy. In core setup, the corresponding reductions are 1.82×\\times and 1.78×\\times. The large models dominate spending in this setting, consuming ∼\\sim80% of total hourly cost. Because they require multiple GPUs per replica, Coral has ample room to exploit intra-replica heterogeneity, which drives the savings.

Small-Heavy. Fig. [11(c)](#S6.F11.sf3 "In Figure 11 ‣ 6.4 Goodput Under Scarce Resources ‣ 6 Evaluation ‣ Coral: Cost-Efficient Multi-LLM Serving over Heterogeneous Cloud GPUs") and Fig. [11(d)](#S6.F11.sf4 "In Figure 11 ‣ 6.4 Goodput Under Scarce Resources ‣ 6 Evaluation ‣ Coral: Cost-Efficient Multi-LLM Serving over Heterogeneous Cloud GPUs") report hourly cost for core setup and extended setup. In extended setup, Coral reduces the average hourly cost by 2.34×\\times over Homo and 1.64×\\times over Cauchy. Despite their low arrival rate, Qwen-3 235B and Llama-3 70B are large enough to still account for 40% and 20% of total cost, respectively, so most of Coral’s savings come from these two models. In core setup, all three methods yield nearly identical total cost, with Coral only ∼\\sim10% cheaper on average. This is expected: Phi-4 14B, which dominates cost in this setting, fits on 1–2 GPUs, leaving little room for intra-replica optimization.

### 6.6 Comparison with Helix

![Refer to caption](2605.04357v1/x20.png)

Figure 12: Comparison with Helix on Helix’s "High GPU-Heterogeneity Cluster" setup.

This section compares Coral with Helix \[mei2025helix\], which uses an ILP to optimize model placement for a single model on a fixed heterogeneous node set.

We adopt Helix’s largest experiment setup (“High GPU-Heterogeneity Cluster”) and deliberately configure the comparison in Helix’s favor. The resource pool Coral allocates from contains exactly the same GPU mix as Helix’s cluster (4×\\times A100 40G, 6×\\times V100 16G, 16×\\times L4 24G, and 38×\\times T4 16G), and both systems serve the 70B Llama model. We use the node prices from AWS US-East-2. We set the arrival rate to 4 req/s, exceeding the throughput Helix reports, and impose prefill and decode latency SLOs on Coral of 2090 ms and 730 ms—the median latencies reported in Helix’s online-serving experiments. Helix itself runs unconstrained. Because provisioning 64 GPUs on real hardware is cost-prohibitive, we run Coral in our high-fidelity simulator and compare against the numbers reported by Helix, which were likewise obtained from their own simulator. The goal is to measure Coral’s cost savings under constraints strictly tighter than Helix’s.

As Fig. [12](#S6.F12 "Figure 12 ‣ 6.6 Comparison with Helix ‣ 6 Evaluation ‣ Coral: Cost-Efficient Multi-LLM Serving over Heterogeneous Cloud GPUs") shows, Coral reduces cost by 21% and improves throughput by 26% over Helix while satisfying both latency SLOs. Coral assigns the A100 nodes to prefill and partitions the remaining hardware into three decode Serving Instances, each built from L4 and T4 nodes, leaving 6 V100 nodes and 1 T4 node unused. The gains stem from how each system exploits the resource pool. Helix consolidates all 64 GPUs into a single monolithic pipeline via PP and DP, paying substantial cross-stage communication overhead. Coral instead decomposes the pool into multiple smaller Serving Instances, each running its own throughput-optimal placement and avoiding the overhead of one large pipeline.

### 6.7 Sensitivity Analysis

![Refer to caption](2605.04357v1/x21.png)

Figure 13: Sensitivity of Serving Template generation to the pruning parameters (Nmax,ρ)(N\_{\\max},\\rho). Solving time and template count grow exponentially, while the best template’s cost efficiency plateaus at (6,12)(6,12).

This section analyzes the sensitivity of Coral’s Serving Template generator to the two pruning parameters introduced in Sec. [4.2](#S4.SS2 "4.2 Serving Template Generation ‣ 4 Optimization Formulation in Coral ‣ Coral: Cost-Efficient Multi-LLM Serving over Heterogeneous Cloud GPUs"): the per-template node cap NmaxN\_{\\max} and the memory cap ratio ρ\\rho. Because adding nodes to a template also inflates its aggregate memory, we sweep the two parameters jointly. As a testbed, we use the prefill phase of GPT-OSS 120B and run the generator on an AWS c8i instance with 384 cores. For each (Nmax,ρ)(N\_{\\max},\\rho) pair, we record the number of valid templates produced, the total solving time, and the cost efficiency (Goodput/USD) of the best template found.

Fig. [13](#S6.F13 "Figure 13 ‣ 6.7 Sensitivity Analysis ‣ 6 Evaluation ‣ Coral: Cost-Efficient Multi-LLM Serving over Heterogeneous Cloud GPUs") reports the results. Both the template count and the total solving time grow exponentially with (Nmax,ρ)(N\_{\\max},\\rho), yet the best template’s cost efficiency plateaus at (Nmax,ρ)\=(6,12)(N\_{\\max},\\rho)=(6,12). This is expected: larger node sets incur higher inter-node communication overhead and are dominated by splitting the same resources into multiple smaller replicas. Enumerating beyond the plateau therefore drives up offline cost without unlocking cheaper serving strategies. This confirms the principled-subset argument in Sec. [4.2](#S4.SS2 "4.2 Serving Template Generation ‣ 4 Optimization Formulation in Coral ‣ Coral: Cost-Efficient Multi-LLM Serving over Heterogeneous Cloud GPUs") and justifies our default choice of (Nmax,ρ)\=(6,12)(N\_{\\max},\\rho)=(6,12) during the end-to-end evaluation.

Prefill-Decode (PD) Disaggregated LLM Serving. PD disaggregation exploits the distinct performance characteristics of prefill and decode by provisioning each phase independently \[zhong2024distserve, patel2024splitwise, zhang2025cauchy, hu2024inference, qin2024mooncake\]. Splitwise \[patel2024splitwise\] and DistServe \[zhong2024distserve\] established this split, and Cauchy \[zhang2025cauchy\] extends it by selecting different GPU configurations for the prefill and decode pools. Heterogeneity in these systems, however, is confined to the phase boundary: each replica still runs on a single homogeneous configuration. Coral is complementary and admits heterogeneity _within_ a replica via hybrid pipeline- and data-parallelism, while jointly optimizing allocation and placement across all models. It applies to PD-disaggregated and PD-aggregated serving alike (Sec. [5.1](#S5.SS1 "5.1 System Design ‣ 5 Coral Runtime ‣ Coral: Cost-Efficient Multi-LLM Serving over Heterogeneous Cloud GPUs")).

Resource Allocation for LLM Serving. A second line of work provisions and scales LLM serving resources under shifting demand, prices, and availability \[miao2024spotserve, mao2025skyserve, jaiswal2025sageserve\]. SpotServe \[miao2024spotserve\] exploits preemptible instances to reduce cost while tolerating preemption, SkyServe \[mao2025skyserve\] allocates replicas across regions and clouds with spot/on-demand autoscaling, and SageServe \[jaiswal2025sageserve\] combines workload forecasting with scaling and routing to reduce reconfiguration overhead. These systems optimize cluster-level provisioning, replica allocation, or request routing, but treat each replica as a fixed, internally homogeneous configuration. Coral is complementary: it jointly decides _which_ heterogeneous resources to allocate _and_ how each model is placed across them, unlocking intra-replica heterogeneity that these systems leave on the table.

Heterogeneous LLM Serving. Prior work exploits heterogeneous GPUs for LLM serving along several axes. Mélange \[griggs2024m\] shows that the most cost-efficient GPU type depends on workload characteristics and SLOs, but selects a single homogeneous type per deployment. A recent study \[jiang2025demystifying\] jointly optimizes GPU composition, placement, and workload assignment, but minimizes offline batch makespan under a fixed budget on a static resource pool—the dual of Coral’s problem, and without online reconfiguration. Helix \[mei2025helix\] and HexGen \[jiang2023hexgen\] optimize model placement over a _fixed_ heterogeneous pool, leaving resource selection out of scope; as discussed in Sec. [4.1](#S4.SS1 "4.1 Solution Overview ‣ 4 Optimization Formulation in Coral ‣ Coral: Cost-Efficient Multi-LLM Serving over Heterogeneous Cloud GPUs"), wrapping them in an outer allocation loop is intractable. BOute \[jiang2026boute\] jointly routes and places across heterogeneous LLMs and GPUs, but still assumes a fixed device set and focuses on selecting among model variants to trade off latency and quality. Coral is the first to jointly select heterogeneous resources _and_ place models across them for multiple LLMs under per-model latency SLOs.

Multi-Model LLM Serving. Several systems target efficient concurrent serving of multiple LLMs. Prism \[yu2025prism\] enables GPU sharing with dynamic memory redistribution across colocated models, Aegaeon \[xiang2025aegaeon\] performs token-granularity autoscaling for effective GPU pooling, and FlexPipe \[lin2025flexpipe\] multiplexes models in fragmented serverless clusters via dynamic pipeline refactoring. These systems improve sharing, pooling, and scheduling on a _given_ resource pool, but do not decide which heterogeneous resources to provision or how to place each model across them. Coral complements them by solving this upstream joint optimization under per-model latency SLOs; their runtime mechanisms could be layered on top of the Serving Instances Coral produces.

8 Conclusion
------------

This paper presents Coral, an adaptive heterogeneity-aware system for cost-efficient multi-LLM serving. Coral jointly optimizes resource allocation and model placement through a lossless two-stage decomposition: offline ILP-based _Serving Template_ generation and online template selection across regions. Lifting placement search off the critical path shrinks the online solve from hours to tens of seconds, letting the cluster continuously adapt to shifting demand and availability. Across 6 models and 20 GPU configurations, Coral reduces serving cost by up to 2.79×2.79\\times and delivers up to 2.39×2.39\\times higher goodput under scarce resource availability.
